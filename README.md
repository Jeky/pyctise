# Pyctise
This is a project including some tiny python files.

## How to run

1. Install git on your machine. If you are using Windows, you can install **GitBash** which provides not only git feature, but a bash shell as well. If you are using Mac or Linux, please just install git from you terminal.

2. Install Python 3 and add Python 3 to your path. You can refer to [this answer](https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-to-add-python-to-the-windows-path) and change the directory to where your python is.

3. Open your gitbash, and try to type:

```Bash
python --version
```

You will see something like this: 
```
Python 3.6.0
```

This means you have successfully installed everything.

4. Now just clone this repo: 

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeky/pyctise.git
```

5. Everything is done. Now you can go to the cloned directory and run some code there:

```Bash
cd pyctices
python bubble_sort.py
```
